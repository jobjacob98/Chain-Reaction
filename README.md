# Chain Reaction #

Chain Reaction is a strategic board game that can be played by 2-8 players. We developed an AI agent for playing this game against a single opponent. The agent decides its moves using the alphaâ€“beta pruning algorithm. <br/>

The game was developed in JavaScript using a HTML5 game framework called Phaser. The agent was developed in Python and an API was built using Flask to link the game and the agent. <br/>

This repo contains all the code related to this project. <br/>

How to use: <br/>
1) Install Flask: http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/1.0/installation/ <br/>
2) Download this repo. <br/>
3) Run the api.py file. <br/>
4) The browser will automatically pop-up with the game. Enjoy playing!
